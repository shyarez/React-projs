# 🚀 React Learning Playground
Welcome to my React learning folder — a hands-on space where I explore core concepts, build mini components, and sharpen my front-end skills. 
Each file here is focused, beginner-friendly, and designed to help me master React fundamentals with clean syntax and practical examples.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- 🃏 **Card Components** — reusable UI blocks with props and styling
- 📧 **Props** — passing data into components (*Note: `defaultProps` deprecated in React 19+)
- ❓ **Conditional Rendering** — show/hide elements based on logic
- 📃 **Render Lists** — map over arrays to display dynamic content
- 👆 **Click Events** — handle user interactions with `onClick`
- 🎣 **useState() Hook** — manage local component state
- 🚦 **onChange Event Handler** — track input changes in real time
- 🔄 **Updater Functions** — safely update state based on previous values
- 🚗 **Update Objects in State** — merge and modify nested data
- 🚘 **Update Arrays of Objects in State** — add, remove, or edit items immutably
- 🌟 **useEffect() Hook** — run side effects like fetching data or syncing state
- 🧗‍♂️ **useContext() Hook** — share global state across components
- 🗳️ **useRef() Hook** — access DOM nodes or persist values without re-rendering
