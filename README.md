# ⚛️ React Projects
Welcome to my **React Projects** folder >> a curated set of beginner-to-intermediate apps built to sharpen my front-end skills & showcase practical React concepts. Each project is designed with clean UI, functional logic, and modern hooks.

## --- 🧩 Included Projects ---

- 🎨 **Color Picker**  
  A minimalist app to select colors, preview them live, copy hex codes, and toggle dark mode.

- 📝 **To-Do List**  
  A task manager with add/delete functionality, conditional rendering, and dynamic list updates.

- ⏰ **Digital Clock**  
  A real-time clock component using `useEffect()` and `setInterval()` for smooth updates.

  A responsive stopwatch with start, pause, and reset controls — built using `useState()` and `useRef()`.

## 📚 Attached: React Basics Learning Folder
Alongside the projects, I’ve included a dedicated **React Basics** folder where I’ve explored:

- 🃏 Card components  
- 📧 Props (*with note on `defaultProps` deprecation in React 19+)  
- ❓ Conditional rendering  
- 📃 List rendering  
- 👆 Click events  
- 🎣 `useState()` hook  
- 🚦 `onChange` event handler  
- 🔄 Updater functions  
- 🚗 Updating objects in state  
- 🚘 Updating arrays of objects  
- 🌟 `useEffect()` hook  
- 🧗‍♂️ `useContext()` hook  
- 🗳️ `useRef()` hook  

This folder reflects my hands-on learning process and serves as a reference for building scalable React apps.
